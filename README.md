# Simple Neural Network
A simple neural network created on the basis of Andrew Trask's (@iamtrask) tutorial for Python.  
You can find detailed information here: http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/  
My version is written in JavaScript and jQuery.

You can test this simple neural network in your web browser by downloading the repository (only index.html and neural-network.js files are needed). 

There's also a [newer version](https://github.com/milan5599/simple-neural-network/tree/version-with-user-input) with userdata input.
