# Simple Neural Network
A simple neural network created on the basis of Andrew Trask's (@iamtrask) tutorial for Python.  
You can find detailed information here: http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/  
My version is written in JavaScript and jQuery.

You can test this simple neural network in your web browser by downloading [index.html](/index.html) and [neural-network.js](neural-network.js) files.
